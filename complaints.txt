Stitches in lip. Questions about healing process/ infection?
So 6 days ago I was bit by my sister's dog and my lip was in two pieces. The person who stitch me up at the hospital didn't clean it before she started stitching, I did get a tetanus shot and amoxicillin. She neglected to tell me how to take care of it. She made it seem like don't mess with it wait for the stitches to dissolve. Well some of the stitches came off but there all basically under a scab, a couple stitches came out. There is a very minimal amount of white pus. Does that mean I have an infection? I've been taking the antibiotics.

My symptoms started first with coordination issues and unsteadiness, brain fog. Then my legs and arms got weak, especially legs when i walk. Lately I developed some joint pains that come and goes and i have pain in my left heel. I feel pain sometimes under my left ribs and right ribs. I have blurry vision, elevated resting heart rate (even while sleeping). I also feel tired, almost like I have a flu fatigue, when I'm walking I sometimes feel weird pressure on my sides of the head, not really like pain, its more like blood flow, its hard to say, I also feel flushing of my cheeks. My back is itching pretty bad as well. This has been ongoing for more then 2 months now.
